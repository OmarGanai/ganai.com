              <p>I'm a Product Manager & Consultant at <a href="http://habitry.com">Habitry</a>, a behavior change consulting company I helped build in 2014. I have a M.A. and "all but dissertation PhD" in Organizational Psychology from the University of Waterloo, and a B.A. with honors in Psychology from San Jos√© State University. My area of study was the social psychology of motivation, with a focus on improving satisfaction and productivity in workplace social systems (such as teams and communities). While in academia I started to feel a gap between what I was studying and how behavior change is actually implemented in organizations. So I left to become a Business Analyst at Cisco Systems (a Fortune 100 company). There, I got a taste of how to orchestrate behavior change across teams and organizations. Feeling more ambitious, I left Cisco to help build Habitry. Since then, I've been working to bridge the gap between Behavior Change Science and its practical applications in business and technology. I'm currently writing <em>Motivating Humans: The Science and Lore of Behavior Change</em> with Steven M. Ledbetter.

              <p>

                I'm an expert in the practical application of Motivation and Behavior Change Science. I've made companies, products, and services that have helped thousands of people change their behavior. Born in Lahore, Pakistan, I grew up in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the U.A.E.), North American states (Minnesota and California) and Canadian provinces (Alberta and Ontario). I currently reside in Toronto, Canada. I enjoy being a bro at the gym, reading heavy philosophical books, attending electronic music festivals, and trying to win the affection of my 3 year old niece.</p>
