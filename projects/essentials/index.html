														<h2>The Mission</h1>

														<p>In 2014, Omar teamed up with <a href="http://habitry.com">Habitry</a> co-founders Steven M. Ledbetter and Vanessa Naylon to work on our mission of <b>"helping the most people to help the most people"</b> by making products for health coaches.</p>

														<p>After launching <a href="../habitryios/">Habitry iOS</a>, coaches began to ask Habitry for a more comprehensive education product that would allow them to bring the behavioral psychology techniques they had been introduced to in the iOS app into real world settings.</p> <p>This is the story of how Omar made Essentials of Habit Coaching, the core feature of <a href="../habitrypros">Habitry Professionals</a>. </p>

														<h2>A Learning Design Problem</h2>
														<p>Thanks to Motivation and Behavior Change Science, we've known how to help people change their behavior for over 40 years.</p>
														<p>Yet the practical know-how from this vast evidence base has remained out of the reach of coaching professionals.</p>
														<p>Because building coaching competence takes time, resources, and a high-touch, costly approach. So the coaching industry remains filled with quackery, employee disengagement, and turnover.</p>

														<span class="image titleimg left "><img src="vision.jpg" width=alt=""/></span>
														<h2>The Approach</h2>

														<p>As with  <a href="../habitryios/">Habitry iOS</a> and <a href="../habitrypros/">Habitry Professionals</a>, Habitry took a Lean UX approach to figuring out potential customer pain points, testing potential solutions, and evaluating our ongoing efforts to iterate rapidly toward the right product. This meant getting a MVP prototype in front of users ASAP, watching them use it, and refining the product with each round of customer interaction to drive improvements in product quality.</p>

														<p>We leaned heavily on the approach to Learning Design developed by <a href="http://usablelearning.com">Julie Dirksen</a> and the <em>Lens of Intrinsic Skill Atoms</em> developed by <a href="http://codingconduct.cc">Sebastian Deterding</a>.</p>

														<h2>Discovery</h2>

														<p>On the advice of Angel Investor <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Jesse_Robbins">Jesse Robbins</a>, Habitry started a series of <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Unconference">Unconferences</a> — <b><a href="http://www.motivatesumm.it">The Motivate Summits</a></b>. These open, unscripted gatherings proved to be a fertile ground for exploring the non-technical approaches that health coaches were using, and the great lengths to which they were going to scale their businesses into "the other 167 hours" a week they were not with their clients.</p>
														<p>Once Habitry had customers using Habitry iOS, we also brought in those customers for interviews. These interviews highlighted  gaps between between the skills they had and wanted to learn, and their learning experiences with the solutions they were already using to improve their coaching skills. </p>

														<h2>Ideation</h2>
														<h3>Defining Requirements</h3>
														<p>Using notes from the Discovery process, we developed personas of both coaches and clients to guide us through the ideation process. This customer development work suggested some features that we validated against the work done by researcher and intervention designer <a href="http://www.johnmarshallreeve.org">Johnmarshall Reeve</a>.</p>
