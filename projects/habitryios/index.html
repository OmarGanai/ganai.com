							<h2>The Mission</h1>

							<p>In 2014, Omar teamed up with <a href="http://habitry.com">Habitry</a> co-founders Steven M. Ledbetter and Vanessa Naylon to work on our mission of <b>"helping the most people to help the most people"</b> by making products for health coaches.</p>

							<p>Our central hypothesis was that the most effective and efficient way to help clients change their health behavior was in groups. However health coaches had no tools to work in groups online that preserved their high-touch, one-on-one approach.</p>

							<h2>A Motivation Design Problem</h2>
							<p>Most health coaches: "I  need  to  coach  more  people,  but  I’m  exhausted  and  have  no  way  to  scale  my  business.”</p>
							<p>Most people who seek health & fitness: "Apps  are  convenient,  but  they  don’t  keep  me  motivated.  If  only  there  was  a  way  to  hire  an  expert  I  trust  to  keep  me  motivated  with  the  convenience  of  an  app.”</p>

							<h2>The Approach</h2>

							<p>Habitry took a Lean UX approach to figuring out potential customer pain points, potential solutions, and how to measure the results.</p>
							<p>This meant front-loading a lot of hypothesis testing with rapid prototyping, customer interviews, and mock ups.</p>

							<h2>Discovery</h2>

							<p>On the advice of Angel Investor <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Jesse_Robbins">Jesse Robbins</a>, Habitry started a series of <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Unconference">Unconferences</a> — <b><a href="http://www.motivatesumm.it">The Motivate Summits</a></b>. These open, unscripted gatherings proved to be a fertile ground for exploring the non-technical approaches that health coaches were using, and the great lengths to which they were going to scale their businesses into "the other 167 hours" a week they were not with their clients.</p>
							<p>We also conducted interviews with clients working with health coaches and people using health coaching apps in lieu of hiring a coach.</p>

							<h2>Design for Motivation & Behavior Change</h2>
							<span class="image titleimg"><img src="designingasystem.png" alt=""/></span>

							<p>Using notes from Discovery, we conducted a <b><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51070630_The_Behaviour_Change_Wheel_a_new_method_for_characterising_and_designing_behaviour_change_interventions">behavioral analysis</a></b> to examine barriers and opportunities to motivate coaches to take action and maximize value from our product.</p>

																			 <td>Coaches lacked information on how to facilitate habit formation in clients. This reduced their confidence in helping clients with behavior change.</td>

							<h2>Design Tactics</h2>
							<p>We aimed to increase Capability, Motivation, and Opportunity by selecting appropriate <b><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236064731_The_Behavior_Change_Technique_Taxonomy_v1_of_93_Hierarchically_Clustered_Techniques_Building_an_International_Consensus_for_the_Reporting_of_Behavior_Change_Interventions">Behavior Change Techniques</a>.</b></p>

							<h2>Improving Capability</h2>
							<p>We helped coaches support client habit formation by automating the behavior change techniques of Goal-Setting, Action Planning, Behavioral Contracts, Feedback on Behavior, Self-Monitoring of Behavior, and Push Notifications (aka the behavior change technique of "Prompts"). </p>
							<p>We educated coaches on how to create Positive Motivational Climates in their groups with the use of Autonomy Support, Competence Support, and Relatedness Support. This later became our <a href="../essentials">Essentials of Habit Coaching</a> product.</p>

							<h2>Improving Motivation</h2>
								<p>The next step was to improve Motivation.</p>

								<p>We helped coaches to get started with as little fuss as possible by designing a great onboarding experience (Shaping Knowledge, Goal-Setting, Valued Self-Identity), habits to use with clients (Shaping Knowledge).

								<p>We also built an analytics system that generated insights (Feedback on Behavior & Re-attrbition) so they could better manage their groups.</p>

							<span class="image titleimg left"><img src="motivatenyc2.jpg" alt=""/></span>

							<h2>Improving Opportunity</h2>
								<p>The final step was to improve  Opportunity.</p>

								<p>We created the Motivate Collective to provide Social Support, Shape Knowledge, and create a Valued Self-Identity for health coaches as MOTIVATORS. At it's peak, there were 600+ members in the Motivate Collective.</p>

							<h2>Push Notifications</h2>
							<p>In testing, it became obvious that the make-or-break feature of the mobile app woud be push notifications. Coaches and their clients had both mentioned them frequently in discovery, and in 2014 people weren't quite sick of them yet.</p>
							<p>In order to make sure we got it right, Omar looked at the research on creating motivating push notifications from Self-Determination Theory. Then he went a step further and recreated one of the study protocols. He and Steven M. Ledbetter wrote about the lessons from this experiment in <b><a href="http://habitry.link/push">How to Design Motivating Push Notifications.</a></b></p>
