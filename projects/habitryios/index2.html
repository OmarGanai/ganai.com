							<h2>The Mission</h1>

							<p>In 2014, Omar teamed up with <a href="http://habitry.com">Habitry</a> co-founders Steven M. Ledbetter and Vanessa Naylon to work on our mission of <b>"helping the most people to help the most people"</b> by making products for health coaches.</p>

							<p>Our central hypothesis was that the most effective and efficient way to help clients change their health behavior was in groups. However health coaches had no tools to work in groups online that preserved their high-touch, one-on-one approach.</p>

							<h2>A Motivation Design Problem</h2>
							<p>Most health coaches: "I  need  to  coach  more  people,  but  I’m  exhausted  and  have  no  way  to  scale  my  business.”</p>
							<p>Most people who seek health & fitness: "Apps  are  convenient,  but  they  don’t  keep  me  motivated.  If  only  there  was  a  way  to  hire  an  expert  I  trust  to  keep  me  motivated  with  the  convenience  of  an  app.”</p>

							<h2>What if there was a way to scale coaching so more health coaches could help more clients, with the convenience of an app?</h2>

							<h2>The Approach</h2>

							<p>Habitry took a Lean UX approach to figuring out potential customer pain points, potential solutions, and how to measure the results.</p>
							<p>This meant front-loading a lot of hypothesis testing with rapid prototyping, customer interviews, and mock ups.</p>

							<h2>Discovery</h2>

							<p>On the advice of Angel Investor <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Jesse_Robbins">Jesse Robbins</a>, Habitry started a series of <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Unconference">Unconferences</a> — <b><a href="http://www.motivatesumm.it">The Motivate Summits</a></b> — as a cheap way to surface customer problems and workshop solutions. These open, unscripted gatherings proved to be a fertile ground for exploring the non-technical approaches that health coaches were using, and the great lengths to which they were going to scale their businesses into "the other 167 hours" a week they were not with their clients.</p>
							<p>We also conducted interviews with clients working with health coaches and people using health coaching apps in lieu of hiring a coach.</p>
